        <p>At Funding loans can be taken from multiple lenders who avail this platform to help borrowers get loans at
            an economical rate of interest and in the process, earn a higher interest rate than what they would if they
            kept their money idle. This process is mutually beneficial and is a win-win situation for both parties.</p>

        <p>The lenders listed on Funding.com are High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs), who are doing well in their
            respective professions, or institutional lender like NBFC. Funding ensures that only the most genuine
            lenders are interacting with the borrowers, hence, every potential lender is registered only after they give
            an undertaking about the authenticity of their credentials, income details etc.</p>
