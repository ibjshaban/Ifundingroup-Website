        <h3><strong>Why Borrow on Funding</strong></h3>

        <p>Borrowers have always been at the receiving end. Traditionally, it is the lender who decides the amount that
            a borrower can get as well as the rate of interest. Now, for the first time, Funding empowers the borrower
            and makes him an equal to the lender. It is a unique P2P platform that brings potential borrowers and
            lenders together to facilitate their transactions.</p>

        <p>Funding is a fair and open online marketplace where borrowers can borrow money directly from individuals and
            institutional lenders thereby removing intermediary costs and margins and get better rate of interest as
            compared to banks and other financial institutions. Credit worthy borrowers can expect multiple lenders
            interested to fund their requirements.</p>
