    <h3>Cancelation And Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Funding strongly recommends that all members – Lenders and Borrowers – read, understand and familiarize
        themselves with our cancellation & refund policy prior to using any services of Funding.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        No overseas payment can be made through wire transfer or any other means to our bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event of cancellation of services due to any avoidable/unavoidable reasons we must be notified of the
        same in writing at <a href="{{ route('contactus') }}">support@Funding.com</a>. Cancellation charges will be effective from the date we receive advice
        in writing, and cancellation charges would be as per the grid provided under the Terms and Conditions.

    <p>
        Any refunds, if applicable within the purview of our refund policy, will be processed over a period of 2-4 weeks
        due to Indian banking procedures. The refund policy is subject to change by Funding.com. The changes will apply
        after due legal diligence. Suitable announcements will be made on the website and legally-compliant notice
        period will be given before any changes come into force. If lenders or borrowers do not wish to accept the
        revised policy, lenders or borrowers should not continue to use the services and inform us about the same on

    </p>
    <p>
        If lenders or borrowers continue to use the services after the date on which the change comes into effect,
        lenders or borrowers use of the services indicates your agreement to be bound by the new refund policy.
