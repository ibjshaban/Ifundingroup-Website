    <h3>How FUNDING Works</h3>
    <p>
        Funding is India's first peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform to receive a Certificate of Registration (CoR) as
        an NBFC-P2P from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Our mission is to provide a marketplace that connects
        individuals in need for credit with individuals and institutes willing to lend their access funds. We use
        technology to speed up the process and cut costs. Thus, we provide an opportunity to the borrowers to get their
        requirements funded at viable rates and help lenders get the best possible return on their investment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, our services can be availed only by Indian Residents. Once an interested individual seeks to
        register, we undertake a detailed verification process following KYC norms as laid down by various regulators.
        Thus, all personal and financial information pertaining to Borrowers and Lenders visible on Funding has been
        verified.

    <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>
        On Funding, visitors, as per their requirement, can register as lenders or borrowers. Funding undertakes a
        comprehensive verification process based on personal, financial and professional information provided of all its
        registered Borrowers and Lenders.
    </p>
    <p>
        An automated system suggests the loan period, loan amount and interest rate against each Borrower’s profile,
        which is indicative of the Borrower’s capability to efficiently repay the loan. Lenders can make offers to fund
        borrower’s requirement which are accepted on first come first serve basis. Both borrowers and lenders can strike
        deals with multiple members. Thus, lenders can fund a portion of the total loan requirement of multiple
        borrowers and borrowers can seek to raise money from multiple lenders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once an agreement is reached between the borrower and the lender, a formal contract is signed by them. The loan
        amount is then transferred to the borrower’s account and the borrower makes periodic repayments via EMI over the
        stipulated time period.
    </p>
    <P>
        Repayment can be done through an online, automated process and tracked via their unique account on
        www.Funding.com. Funding provides a fair, transparent, technology-driven platform for the whole process to
        happen smoothly and quickly.
