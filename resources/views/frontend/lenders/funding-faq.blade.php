            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Why borrow through Funding?</p>

            <p>A: Funding offers the borrowers a lower interest rate and less hassle than traditional financing
                options. It offers attractive fixed rates, an easy online application, friendly service and no hidden
                fees.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: How do I get started?</p>

            <p>A: Simply click on the Sign Up Now icon and register through the simple step by step process as
                instructed. Once you have filled the basic information required, paid the non-refundable filing fee and
                uploaded the documents required, Funding risk assessment team will identity-verify, credit-check and
                risk-assess your profile. If qualified, your registration as a Borrower will be approved and you can
                apply for loan on the Funding platform.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Why do you require documents?</p>

            <p>The documents are required to identity-verify, credit-check and risk-assess a borrower before
                registration. Apart from the CIBIL score, we use various other parameters like ability, stability, past
                performance and intention of the borrowers, which are evaluated basis these documents. The documents
                provided like salary slips, bank statements, ITR’s, balance sheets etc. help in taking a collective and
                transparent decision ensuring a fair field for the borrower.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Why should I pay filing fee and that too before getting the loan?</p>

            <p>The filing fee is towards the considerable time, effort and resources spent by our fully-automated credit
                evaluation mechanism to carefully assesses each borrower profile. The filing fee is non-refundable but
                gets adjusted towards the loan processing fees, if the borrower is funded through the Funding
                portal.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: How much can I borrow?</p>

            <p>A: At Funding, loan disbursal is dependent on loan requirement. For personal requirements, loan amount
                can vary from Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 5,00,000/-. For business purpose, a borrower can apply for a loan upto
                Rs. 10,00,000/-.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Over what time frame can I borrow? What is the tenure of loans on
                Funding.com?</p>

            <p>A: Currently, loan tenures are fixed from minimum 6 months to maximum 36 months. Funding is working on
                making it operationally feasible to let Borrowers borrow for longer periods.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Will I be funded by an individual lender or by multiple lenders?</p>

            <p>A: As per Funding policy, no single lender can fund the entire loan requirement of a borrower. Hence,
                your loan will be funded by multiple lenders.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Can I pre-pay my EMI? Can I repay my loan early if I like? Are there any
                charges?</p>

            <p>A: Pre-closure of loan can be done after three months from the disbursal of the loan without any
                additional charges. Prior to three months, to protect lender interest, pre-closure can be done after
                paying balance interest due to lenders for a period of three months from the date of disbursal. This is
                payable directly to Lenders. Funding charges a one-time non-refundable pre-payment fees of Rs.
                500/-.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Can I choose my monthly repayment date?</p>

            <p>A: The repayment date can be decided mutually between the Funding team and the Borrower for any date
                between the 1st – 10th of every month. This is decided basis the date on which the borrower’s salary is
                credited.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: What interest rates can I expect to pay?</p>

            <p>A: Interest rates are suggested to each borrower by an automated credit appraisal system that uses the
                personal and financial information provided by borrowers across more than 120 criteria using more than
                400 data points to risk-asses the borrowers and understand the strength of their credit profile. The
                interest rate thus assigned ranges from 12% to 28%. However, Unrated Borrowers can be registered at
                higher interest rate.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: On what parameters does Funding verify my profile and check my
                credit-worthiness?</p>

            <p>A: We use a highly-developed, technology-driven process of verification across more than 120 criteria
                using more than 400 data points basis the personal and financial information and documents provided by
                the borrower. Each borrower is identity-checked, credit-checked and risk-assessed by our experienced
                team. The intention, stability and ability of borrowers is evaluated and understood.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Does Funding.com undertake physical verification?</p>

            <p>A: Yes, Physical verification at both residential and official address is undertaken after prior
                appointment. This is undertaken to verify the identity of the Borrower.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Does Funding require references?</p>

            <p>A: Yes, as part of the verification process, we require 4 references from your professional or personal
                contacts who should be able to verify your identity, intention, ability and stability to take and repay
                a loan.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: How much time does it generally take before a loan is listed?</p>

            <p>A. Once a borrower Signs Up, provides basic information, pays the non-refundable filing fee and uploads
                the required documents, the risk assessment team takes 48-72 (office) hours to evaluate and verify the
                borrower; basis which the credit appraisal mechanism sets the parameters for the loan –loan amount, rate
                of interest and loan tenure. Once the borrower accepts the same, the profile is made live on the portal.
                Thus, your loan requirement will be available on the website for lenders to fund between 48-72 hours
                from your first log-in on the website.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: How much time does it take to find a lender? How long can my loan request be
                available for lenders to fund?</p>

            <p>A: All loans are listed on the platform for 15 days which may, under special circumstances, be extended
                to a maximum of 30 days. This is known as listing period. However, the funding of the loan cannot be
                predicted or controlled as it is dependent upon attracting sufficient lenders. Credit-worthy borrowers
                can get funded within minutes and some borrowers assigned high rate of interest can take a few days. You
                can monitor lenders interest anytime by logging into your account.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: How long is the disbursal process?</p>

            <p>A: The disbursal process starts only after the borrower has paid the processing fees, signed the loan
                agreement and provided the PDCs, NACH Mandate and any other documents required. This process is driven
                by borrower interest. By using technology-driven facilities available only on Funding you can reduce
                this time to less than 24 hours. Post this process funds are transferred from lender’s escrow account to
                the borrower’s bank account within 12-24 hours. Thus, the entire disbursal process takes 24-48 hours. It
                is transparent and driven by borrower and lender interest with Funding acting only as a
                facilitator.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Why was my application declined?</p>

            <p>A: Funding holds the right to decline a listing in certain cases such as:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The Borrower is unable to provide complete documentation or the same cannot be authenticated.</li>
                <li>These documents are required to evaluate the borrower’s credit-worthiness and intention/stability
                    and ability to take and repay loan. Any deficiency on these parameters or in terms of past
                    loan-performance of the borrower will lead to cancellation of listing of the borrower.
                </li>
                <li>Physical verification report is negative. It is established that the Borrower does not reside or
                    work at the address submitted by the borrower.
                </li>
                <li>Borrower has not paid the filing fee.</li>
                <li>If at any stage of loan application, Funding finds that misleading information was deliberately
                    provided by the borrower with intentions to cheat and hurt the Funding system, its Lenders,
                    founders, stake holders, partners or employees or to infringe or steal the intellectual property of
                    Funding.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: What happens in case of delayed or non-payment of EMI?</p>

            <p>A: Borrowers are morally and legally obliged to pay all dues in a timely manner. In case the EMI is not
                paid on the scheduled time, a penal interest is payable as per Funding policy for each instance of
                delayed repayment. These charges are paid to lenders. Funding will also charge a non-refundable
                collection penalty per delayed payment. So, Funding encourages all borrowers to make timely payments to
                avoid penalty charges.</p>

            <p>In the worst-case scenario, if Funding has to issue a legal notice to a defaulting borrower on behalf of
                the lenders then a non-refundable charge of Rs. 500/- per legal notice will be payable by the borrower
                to Funding.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: I have defaulted on loan payments before or Banks/Financial Institutions have
                rejected my loan application. Can I borrow on Funding?</p>

            <p>A: Funding will not approve of a listing if it does not meet with our credit and verification standards.
                However, we encourage applicants to work on improving their credit history by repaying their debt in a
                timely manner and then try again after six months.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: How are repayments calculated?</p>

            <p>A: Repayments are equated monthly installments calculated using the reducing balance method. Your
                installment per month will remain the same throughout the tenure of your loan. The first installment may
                be different depending on the date of disbursal.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Will Funding provide me with my credit score?</p>

            <p>A: Funding does not provide you with your credit score.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: What information can be viewed about me?</p>

            <p>A: Once your listing has been approved by Funding, your profile can be viewed by all registered Lenders.

                our <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Can I change the loan amount I want to borrow after applying?</p>

            <p>A: No, to avoid confusions and maintain lender interest, we do not make changes to a listing after it has
                been made live on the website. To increase the loan amount, you can create a fresh loan request for the
                difference.</p>

            <p class="faq-heading">Q: Can my loan request be terminated or reviewed at any stage?</p>

            <p>A: Yes, if at any stage the information furnished by you or the verification(s) initiated by us are found
                to be incomplete, fraudulent or unverifiable then funding request is terminated and consequently, the
                invest button on the profile would be de-activated. No fee paid will be refunded.</p>
