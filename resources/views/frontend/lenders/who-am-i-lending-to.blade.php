    <h3>Know Your Borrower</h3>
    <p>
        Borrowers on Funding are people who are credit worthy but do not want to pay high interest to banks; people who
        are smart enough to take charge of their borrowing, just as Lenders are people who want to take control of how
        they want to invest their idle funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Funding provides a bouquet of borrowers with varying credit profiles who would be ready to give different rates
        of interest depending upon their need and credit worthiness. At Funding, you can build a portfolio for yourself
        just the way banks do. We do not allow a lender to fund more than 20% of a borrower’s loan requirement. This is
        to encourage Lenders to hedge their risk by diversifying their lending portfolio and not put all their eggs in
        one basket.
    </p>
    <p>
        Funding has a strict listing criterion for evaluating each and every borrower before they are allowed to be
        listed on the P2P platform. Funding physically checks their office and residential addresses, it verifies their
        income statements, payment capabilities, past performance in order to understand their ability, stability and
        intent. Funding evaluates each borrower on more than 120 criteria across 400 data points which includes
        Financial, Professional, Social and educational background, loan records, etc. to cherry pick only the most
        eligible borrowers for Lender’s perusal. All such information about each borrower is shared on the borrower
        listing page so that an informed decision can be taken by Lenders.
